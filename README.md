Earth Protector - submission in JS1024

Earth civilization is under threat by meteor strikes. Take the role of an air defense system in this mobile friendly survival game and try to best a high score.


### Gameplay:

Protect Earth by destroying the incoming meteorites before they hit the ground. Try to intercept the meteorites mid-air by firing missiles at the right place and time. Earth can only survive a few meteor strikes. There is a green bar in the center of the screen showing the remaining health - the game is over when the green bar disappears. Firing missiles costs a small fraction of health, while destroying meteorites restores a bigger chunk of health depending on how accurate you are, so try to keep your fire to a minimum and aim to destroy multiple meteors with one shot for best impact.


### Controls:

**Click / Tap** on the bottom half of the screen to fire missiles. The point of detonation of each missile depends on the launch placement in a mirror-like manner, e.g. if you launch a missile from the bottom left corner of the screen, the missile will detonate in the top left corner.

**Click / Tap + Hold** to charge and fire a bigger, more powerful, but slower missile - useful for destroying multiple meteorites at once.

### Notes:

This game was coded in pure ES6 Javascript and minified with Terser / Regpack. Development was a lot of fun and provided me with a much needed relaxing experience. Big thanks to the organizer of the jam for the responsiveness and for adding a few details to the shim to provide a more mobile-friendly environment. Cheers!
